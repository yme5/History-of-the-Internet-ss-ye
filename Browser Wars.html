<p>
    Browser wars emerged when the internet was first introduced in the late 1990s roughly between 1995 and 2001.
    It was the competition for dominion over the usage of limited shared web browsers. Browsers are
    applications that allow you to utilize the internet. Some examples of browsers are:
    <li> Microsoft Internet Explorer</li>
    <li> Mozilla Firefox</li>
    <li> Apple Safari</li>
    <li> Google Chrome</li>
